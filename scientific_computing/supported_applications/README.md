# Supported Applications

CSCS provides and supports a selection scientific applications on the computing systems. 
Please follow the links to find out how to run the applications in a production environment.

CSCS staff can also help users with data analysis and visualization to achieve effective data understanding:
* suggesting paradigms of data exploration, data analytics, and classical data analysis to extract information
* adopting the most appropriate I/O library and optimizing their usage for high-scale visualization
* assisting users in migrating to in-situ visualization to overcome the penalty of large I/O to disks
* providing expert tuning of ParaView or VisIt to efficiently load-balance their computations
* selecting the most appropriate visualization and image generation techniques for different scientific fields
